A responsive website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The focus was on building one of my first sites, having fun, and learning!

## Optimizations

When I improve this project, I'd like to add in a functional scheduling back-end system.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned how hard it can be to get good content! I also found the importance of using loops for changes instead of having to do the same thing on 4 pages!
